# Product Catalog Console Application

This is a console application written in TypeScript that allows you to enter products into a catalog. The specific fields for each product type are different, and the application provides a command-line interface for interacting with the catalog.

## Business Requirements

- The application should allow the user to add products to the catalog.
- The input fields required for each product type should vary.
- The application should validate user input and provide appropriate feedback.
- The application should allow the user to view the list of entered products.

## Technical Requirements

- The application is written in TypeScript.
- The user interface is implemented in the console (terminal) using a command-line interface.
- Command validation is mandatory.
- Frameworks and libraries can be used as needed.
- Abstractions are optional but recommended for better code organization.
